	            The VISCA(tm) Camera Control Library

   (C) 2002-2004 by Damien Douxchamps <ddouxchamps@users.sourceforge.net>

==========================================================================
		

(This README is for version 1.0.0)

Nothing special. You should know by now that this lib is for controlling a
VISCA compliant camera (VISCA is a control protocol of Sony Corp.)

This library should also compile under windows but this is untested.

Comments, additional VISCA info, etc... are always welcome.

Have fun,

Damien

Linux Build Instructions
========================

From release tarball
--------------------

Unpack the tarball and run ./configure and make:

```
tar xfz libvisca-1.1.1.tar.gz
cd libvisca
./configure
make
```

From git repo
-------------

Use `autoreconf --install` to create configuation script before building:

```
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/libvisca/git libvisca
cd libvisca
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
```

MinGW32 Build Instructions
==========================

Windows binaries can be built with the MinGW toolchain.
Both native builds on Windows and cross-compiles from Linux should work.

To cross compile from Linux, do the following:

```
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/libvisca/git libvisca
cd libvisca
autoreconf --install
./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
make
```

I haven't tried compiling natively on Windows yet.
